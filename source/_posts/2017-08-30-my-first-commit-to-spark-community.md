I have been worked on spark related projects for almost 2 years. Today I submit a small patch to spark community. Hope to be a contributor~
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21859

It's a PR about SparkFiles.get problem on yarn. Event though it's a small patch, it's a big progress for me to be an open source contributor.
